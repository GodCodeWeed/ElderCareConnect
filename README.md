Project Title: ElderCare Connect - Voice AI Healthcare Assistance
Overview
For the ElderCareConnect, users can call 855-785-3838 to interact with the AI voice system, which provides health-related assistance, reminders, and answers to general or specific healthcare questions. This dedicated phone line ensures easy access for elderly users, particularly those with limited digital literacy, offering a seamless experience for managing daily health tasks and getting medical information over the phone.

By incorporating this phone number, the app makes health support more accessible to users who may not be comfortable using mobile or digital applications.

This system provides culturally sensitive, multilingual responses on topics such as chronic disease management, medication adherence, and general health tips, helping users with limited digital literacy or visual impairments.

Key Features
Voice-Activated Healthcare Assistance:

Users call a dedicated number and ask health-related questions.
AI responds with answers based on reputable medical sources.
Culturally Relevant Multilingual Responses:

The platform tailors responses to the cultural and linguistic needs of minority communities.
Chronic Disease Management Education:

Provides educational content to help users manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.
Medication Support:

Offers voice-activated instructions for medication management, including dosage information and reminders.
Community Health Integration:

Collaborates with local healthcare providers and organizations to offer information relevant to underserved communities.
Problem Statement
Elderly individuals and those who are blind or visually impaired in minority communities face several challenges in accessing healthcare services:

Limited access to healthcare professionals.
Difficulty understanding medical instructions due to low health literacy.
Digital exclusion, as many existing telehealth services require smartphones or internet access.
ElderCare Connect overcomes these barriers by providing voice-based telehealth assistance that is accessible via a regular phone call, ensuring users can access healthcare guidance without needing digital devices or the internet.

Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core: Used for building the backend of the voice interaction service.
Twilio: Provides the telephony services for managing phone calls and capturing user input via speech or keypad input.
OpenAI GPT: Integrated to provide intelligent and dynamic responses to healthcare-related questions based on natural language input.
